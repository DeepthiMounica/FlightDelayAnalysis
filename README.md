## Background

Air travel has become the essential mode of transport for most people in the United States. Air travel is unquestionably the fastest way to get to the destination, but even on shorter trips planes are often quicker. Travelers are inclined towards air travel though it is costlier when compared to other modes of transport. 

Along with the advantages there are also some pain points for the travelers with regards to airline travel. Frequent airline delays and busiest airports are two of the major factors that creates a regression for the better travel experience of the airline travelers.

However, the main reason for this bad customer experience and traveler’s frustration for the flight delays is because the travelers don’t have access to the airline performance data while making the flight ticket reservations. Providing graphical user interface dashboards of the airline performance data helps travelers to make the better decisions for their travel and minimize the traveler's frustration. Frequent airline delays create discomfort, bad customer experience and frustration for the travelers. 

This project addresses some of the key issues that airline travelers face during their travel and provides visualization dashboards that help in better planning while making flight reservations and thereby improving the travel experience for them.

The main goal of this project is to provide interactive dashboards for the airline travelers. These interactive dashboards will be useful for the airline travelers for doing better analysis and proper research while doing airline reservations in the United States of America. This proper analysis internally helps the airline travelers to make a smart choice while booking their flight.
